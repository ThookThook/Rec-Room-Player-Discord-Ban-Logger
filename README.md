# Rec-Room-Player-Discord-Ban-Logger

This repository is a automatic ban log creator for any situation that requires you to manually log bans somewhere from any game, platform, or anyother situation!

This program runs on a web browser bookmarklet for maxinum compatability of platforms!

**ðŸš¨THIS PROGRAM WILL AUTOMATICALLY COPY & PASTE THE FINASL OUTPUT TO CLIPBOARD IF ON PC (tested on windows chrome)
      THAT MAY NOT WORK IF YOU ARE ON MOBILE WHICH WOULD MEAN YOU WOULD NEED TO COPY AND PASTE THE FINAL OUTPUT MANUALLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHERðŸš¨**

The original use and reason for this program existing was to be used for logging bans from the game [Rec Room](https://recroom.com/) and is meant to be used that way (as seen with the name of this repositiory) to be inserted into discord..
This means that this program uses a bunch of Rec Room's (rec net) APIs and is made with the assumption that you are using it that way.
**BUT** you can modify the program how ever you want to to be utilized in any other application you see fit. (If you run or are apart of the staff team of a RR game and you use a system that log bans in discord, this base program will be very convenient and usefulðŸ˜Š)

1. [mainCode.js](https://github.com/ThookThook/Rec-Room-Player-Discord-Ban-Logger/blob/main/mainCode.js) - The base code with comments and all the good stuff with it (does not run on a bookmark itself (JavaScript is hard... ðŸ˜¢)).
2. [bookmarkletCode.js](https://github.com/ThookThook/Rec-Room-Player-Discord-Ban-Logger/blob/main/bookmarkletCode.js) - The code that has been "situatated" to work on a bookmarklet (It's basically just an encapsulated version of [mainCode.js](https://github.com/ThookThook/Rec-Room-Player-Discord-Ban-Logger/blob/main/mainCode.js) without comments)

Enjoy!!!!ðŸ¥° (Please be nice, this is my first repository, and I'm not good with JavaScript)
